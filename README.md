# Econometrics-using-R-to-Py
Translating R code to Python
The final version file is what I was capable of acheiving.
Pandas in python are a copy of the R graphics meaning it is resemebeling its functionality, but is not as good as R.
Using python to acheive what is possible in R has proven quit difficult as databases and visual interface are strengths of R,
but not of python.

Some of the functions in the task does not work as intended, and I was not able to replicate all results from the 
two way fixed effects study.
